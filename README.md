Nginx Config to conect Wing to Panel via VPN Network

This Nginx Config is used to conect a Pterodactyl wing to a Jexactyl or Pterodactyl Panel.
In my case i am using Jexactyl as Panel and i conect the network via Netbird.
I have a VPS with the Panel and one Wing for a Minecraft Proxy.
The Other Nodes have naother Geolocation and i don't wana expose any ports on the routers.
therefor i have This nginx Config.
